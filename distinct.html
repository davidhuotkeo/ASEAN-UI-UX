        <p class="title">The 6th Mass Extinction is Leading to a Biodiversity Dystopia</p>
        <p class="text">
            We live on a planet where we are the enemy. <br><br>
            Humanity is responsible for a beautiful home that used to have such incredible biodiversity.
            As of 2019, we’ve killed off more than 50% of forest animals on Earth, a new report found — even more evidence of a 6th
            mass extinction.<br><br>
            Melting glaciers, unseasonal temperatures, water shortages, forest fires, and an Amazon rainforest now burning are not
            unusual headlines these days.<br><br>
            <strong>Caring vs. Extinction</strong> <br><br>
            Also let’s not forget, scientists have been actually underestimating the pace of Climate Change. Where do we go from
            here? Extinction for us as well is a distinct possibility.
            A growing chorus of even Americans are starting to get worried by global warming, especially people under 50 who will
            actually have to live through some of its consequences.
            Would suing politicians over their crimes against humanity even work? The GDP cost of climate change is also going to
            surprise many.<br><br>
            It just keeps rising! Floods and superstorms today, climate change migrants tomorrow.
            Forest animal populations worldwide have declined 53% since 1970, according to a recent analysis from the World Wildlife
            Fund (WWF). Every year we approach closer a point of no return.<br><br>
            Growing Alarm Among the Youth<br><br>
            As global citizens, we can only live in the moment, but a greater number of young people are starting to get worried
            about the future impact of climate change on our shared future.
            The rapid decline of forest animal populations is yet another sign that the planet is in the midst of a sixth mass
            extinction.<br><br>
            How do you reconcile a planet dying because of our impact? Is our growth and life really so important that it should
            involve so much death?<br><br>
            Is this the sum-total of human love, and our tendency to compete and consume in a global marketplace?
            Are a few decades of consumerism worth the ruining of an entire planet? Clearly whatever ethics we’ve had up to this
            point aren’t working.<br><br>
            The Amazon is burning at record rates — and deforestation is to blame
            How much can my heart stretch to care about a warming arctic or burning jungles? Disappearing coral reefs or species
            extinction? My kind is destructive, we are apparently without remorse.<br><br>
            How much more compassion for starving polar bears should I have? I can not use single-use plastics (like straws), I can
            consume differently but when the system doesn’t care — how do I reconcile the guilt I feel?<br><br>
            In psychology and sociology, we call this a diffusion of responsibility problem. The more people are responsible for the
            problem, the less we feel it matters personally and the more inertia we have to do anything about it.<br><br>
            The 6th Mass Extinction is Leading to a Biodiversity Dystopia<br><br>
            Earth’s forests are emptying. Half of their inhabitants have disappeared in the last 40 years, according to a new report
            from the World Wildlife Fund (WWF). I’ve long feared the 6th mass extinction as a human-caused event.
            The prospect of us surviving our own path of destruction and doing it all over again on other planets terrifies me.
            When it comes to concern about global warming, the good news is that a growing number of Americans are alarmed. Yet the
            United States remains one of the poorest countries when it comes to climate change actions.<br><br>
            How can the country holding up the global GDP now in 2019, be such a tyrant when it comes to climate action? If you are
            American, how do you even stand that?<br><br>
            The Irony of Skepticism and Failure of Nihilism<br><br>
            If technological progress is accelerating so too is our impact upon the world that gave us life.
            Climate change and its impacts are emerging faster than scientists previously thought, consistent with observations in
            the climate change science community that have led to identifying a pattern of underestimation in assessments of climate
            research of certain key climate indicators.<br><br>
            In a mass media of misinformation and wealth-inequality bias, of course, the truth isn’t the truth. First, climate
            skeptics and deniers have often accused scientists of exaggerating the threat of climate change, but the evidence shows
            that not only have they not exaggerated, they have underestimated.<br><br>
            Climate change scientists are conservative. Science has a way of understating our changing world, which now we can see
            with our own eyes! Oddly this tendency could be dangerous.<br><br>
            That scientists tend to underestimate the severity of threats and the rapidity with which they might unfold with
            reality, even over-taking “dire simulations” of just a few years ago, shows that we should actually be worried.
            But as people, we aren’t socialized to think about the entire planet. Evolution has primed us to think about ourselves,
            our mate, our family and possibly our community.<br><br>
            To think and care about a tribe that extends to all tribes over the entire Earth is a bit far-fetched for most of us.

                    <li>Species extinction will continue driving us to the brink of what the 6th major extinction will mean for all
                        living
                        things here</li>

        <p class="text">
            Nobody talks about what it will be like to live on Earth after the 6th major extinction has fully taken place.<br><br>
            OneZero would like to cite books (product placements), framing the end of the world as some sort of kind of fiction in a
            polished article.<br><br>
            But even as we profit from the destruction we are causing our ecosystems, I’m not hearing about much serious activism.
            Where is the voice of the people who don’t actually want their children and grandchildren to live in a climate change
            dystopia?<br><br>
            More than 80% of all terrestrial animal, plant, and insect species call forests home. When forests die, a part of us
            also dies.<br><br>
            You know the Oceans will be next…<br><br>
            Instead, we lead our lives thinking about money or dreaming about the next person we might sleep with, or about the next
            country we want to visit. I guess we just want to seize the day. That’s exactly the sort of thinking that’s led us to
            this place.<br><br>
            Climate models show that deforestation in Central Africa could lead to a 15% drop in rainfall in the US Midwest, and
            Amazon deforestation could cut Texas rainfall by 25%.<br><br>
            When you treat the Earth badly, it also has its own instincts. How do you think a violent cosmos will respond to a
            destructive young species?<br><br>
            Worldwide, 1.6 billion people rely on forests for their livelihoods, including 70 million indigenous people, according
            to the United Nations.<br><br>
            Dystopia will be man-made. Humanity’s vision of utopia will be colonizing a “New Earth”, and doing it all over again.<br><br>
